An Amazon Machine Image(AMI) is pre-configured template that provides the necessary information to launch an EC2 instance in AWS.

It includes:
- Operating System(eg. Linux,Windows)
- Application Server(eg. Apache, Nginx)
- Pre-installed software and configuration.


Its a Template or a blueprint.

Lets suppose I  have a Testing environment, Same environment is supposed to be in the Production.
So, In AWS, I have already created an instance for the Testing environment "mywebserver" now to create an exact image of that for the production environment, I will go to actions--> Create image

We created an image "webserver-v1"
Now we will go to AMIs, here our image would be shown.

Now in production, I want to create an instance , I will directly create it from Image, 
in **images--> select the image--> Launch instance from AMI.**
